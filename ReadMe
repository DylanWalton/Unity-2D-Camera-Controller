To set up the script follow these simple steps :
-> Add the CameraFollow script into your project
-> Add it to the camera as a component (the camera that you want to follow the player)
-> Specify the required parameters and fine tune it to your needs

NOTE : the gizmo (colored area) does not change to show offset, only size. The offset will still work.
